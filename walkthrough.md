Each project of the 20 Common Core contains an encoded hint. For
each circle, only one project provides the correct hint needed for
the next circle. This challenge is individual, there is only a
prize for one student winner providing all decoded messages. Any
advantaged people can play, like current or former staff, but the
prize will remain symbolic. The hint for this first project is:

Large cows generosity comes with charts and four blonde hats to defy upper gravity hero
